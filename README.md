# js-game
Bomb Squad

This JavaScript based game was created in a 1 week sprint, by a 3 member team, in Codecools web module. 
We used Vanilla Javascript, Jinja, HTML and CSS mainly while working on the project.

The main goal is to organize shuffled code chunks back into their useable, original code-block form, before the provided time runs out, to prevent the bomb from blowing up. 
The biggest challenge regarding this project, was the limited time we had, to not just implement the game, but to come up with the base idea, separate the tasks, create the game and add the design.
